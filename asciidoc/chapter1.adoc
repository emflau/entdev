== Installation

[NOTE]
====
Please be very careful in following the installation instructions to the letter. Otherwise, you may end up encountering a lot of issues in using these tools to build enterprise software applications.
====

In this chapter, we will learn how to install the required software packages in the following platforms

[arabic]
. xref:install-win[{ms-win}]
. {mac-osx-cv}
. {ubuntu-cv}

=== [[install-win]] Installation on MS Windows Platform

In this section, we will install the following software packages and set up relevant parameters in a 64-bit MS Windows platform. I am using MS Win 11 x64. Here are the main steps:

[arabic]
. xref:install-jdk-win[Install {openjdk-cv}]
. xref:setup-jdk-policy-win[Set up JDK policy for database connection]
. xref:install-nb-win[Install {apache-nb-cv}]
. xref:setup-nb-win[Set up {apache-nb-cv}]
. xref:install-gf-win[Install {eclipse-gf-cv}]
. xref:setup-gf-win[Set up {eclipse-gf-cv} to work in {apache-nb-cv}]


==== [[install-jdk-win]]Installing {openjdk-cv}

[arabic]
. Downlad {openjdk-cv-url}[{openjdk} version 11 (or, {openjdk-11})] from {adoptium-url}[Adoptium] (See Fig. e1 for a sample)
+
[TIP]
====
. Check that the choosen platform for download is "Windows x64"

. Choose "Temurin 11 (LTS)"

. Select "Latest release"
====

+
[NOTE]
====
. Besides Eclipse's Temurin OpenJDK, there are other jdk providers as well. I have not tried any of these. You may want to use your own favourite OpenJDK provider, but at your own risk.

. Remember where you store the downloaded installation file.
====

. Open a "File Explorer" window

. Browse to the folder where you stored the installation file (usually, it is your Downloads folder)

. Install the JDK by running the installation program and remember to *record* the folder where you install your JDK
+
[NOTE]
====
. You need administrator rights to do this.

. When prompted for "Custom Setup", make sure you set the `Set JAVA_HOME variable` option to `Entire feature will be installed on local hard drive`.

. After the installation, go to `{win-jdk-folder}` (the default JDK's installation folder for MS Windows) to see whether you have it. If you have changed the installation folder during the installation, you better record it. You need to use this folder in later tasks (e.g. xref:java-env-var[Step 5] below). Whenever you see `$\{JDK_ROOT}` in later Lab tasks, you need to replace it with your actual JDK folder name. For example, you may need to replace `$\{JDK_ROOT}` by `{win-jdk-folder}`.

====

. [[set-win-java-env-var]]Set up the environment variables `JAVA_HOME` and `PATH` for Java compiler

.. Open "Control Panel"

.. In the "Control Panel" window, choose "System and Security" and then "System"
+
NOTE: MS Windows will open a "System" window under "Settings".

.. In the "System" window, click on "Advanced system settings" under "Device specifications" and on the right of "Related Links"
+
NOTE: MS Windows will open a "System Properties" window.

.. In the "System Properties" window, do the following

... Select the "Advanced" tab

... Click on the btn:[Environment Variables...] button
+
NOTE: MS Windows will open an "Environment Variables" window.

.. In the "Environment Variables" window, do the following

... In the "User variables for `[your username]` " text area, do the following
+
NOTE: Your actual username in your MS Windows Platform will be shown in the "User variables for `[your username]` " text area. For example, if your username is `emflau`, it will show "User variables for emflau"

.... Click on the btn:[New...] button
+
NOTE: MS Windows will open a "New User Variable" window.

.... In the "New User Variable" window, do the following

..... Enter `JAVA_HOME` in the "Variable name" text field

..... Enter `$\{JDK_ROOT}` in the Variable value" text field
+
NOTE: Remember to substitute `$\{JDK_ROOT}` with the actual folder name you recorded earlier (e.g. `{win-jdk-folder}`)

..... Click on the btn:[OK] button
+
NOTE: Please check that `JAVA_HOME` has now been set properly.

... In the "System variables" text area, select "Path" under the "Variable" column
+
NOTE: You may need to scroll down the text area to find the "Path" variable.

... Click the btn:[Edit...] button under the "System variables" text area
+
NOTE: MS Windows will pop up an "Edit environment variable" window.

... In the "Edit environment variable" window, do the following if you cannot find your `$\{JDK_ROOT}\bin` information after scrolling through the text area

.... Click "New"

.... Enter `$\{JDK_ROOT}\bin`
+
NOTE: Remember to substitute `$\{JDK_ROOT}` with the actual folder name you recorded earlier (e.g. `{win-jdk-folder}`)

.... Click the btn:[OK] button to save the information
+
NOTE: MS Windows will close the "Edit environment variable" window and bring you back to the "Environment Variables" window.

... Click the btn:[OK] button (in the "Environment Variables" window) to save the information
+
NOTE: MS Windows will close the "Environment Variables" window and bring you back to the "System Properties" window.

.. Click the btn:[OK] button (in the "System Properties" window) to save the information
+
NOTE: MS Windows will close the "System Properties" window and bring you back to the "System" window under "Settings"

.. Close the "Settings" window

.. Close the "Control Panel" window

. Verify that `JAVA_HOME` and `PATH` have been set properly

.. Open a new Command Prompt window

.. To check `JAVA_HOME`, type the following in the Command Prompt window

 WIN-PROMPT>echo %JAVA_HOME%
+
The output should be `${JDK_ROOT}` (e.g. `{win-jdk-folder}`).

.. To check `PATH`, type the following in the Command Prompt window

 WIN-PROMPT>echo %PATH%
+
to show the directories that MS Windows will search to find your programs / applications. This time, you should be able to see `${JDK_ROOT}\bin` somewhere in the output (e.g. `\...;{win-jdk-folder}\bin;\...`)

==== [[setup-jdk-policy-win]]Set up JDK policy for database connection

. Open a "File Explorer" window

. Navigate to the folder `$\{JDK_ROOT}\conf\security`
+
NOTE: Remember to substitute `$\{JDK_ROOT}` with the actual folder name you recorded earlier

. Locate the file `java.policy`

. Open your favourite text editor in *administrator* mode to edit the `java.policy` file
+
CAUTION: Make sure you have a backup copy of the file for restoration, in case you mess up the original file.

. Locate the following line in the `java.policy` file
+
[source, text]
 // Standard extensions ...

. Add the following lines to the `java.policy` file just after the line `// Standard extensions \...`
+
[source, text]
grant {
   // add for learning Enterprise Development
   permission java.net.SocketPermission "localhost:1527", "listen,resolve";
 };

+
NOTE: You can add these lines at the end of the file. However, I think it is easier to find these lines at the beginning of a file.

. Save the `java.policy` file

==== [[install-nb-win]]Install {apache-nb-cv}

We will use {apache-nb-cv} (or simply {apache-nb}). You need to install JDK first before installing {apache-nb}. Also, you must set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable beforehand to be able to install {apache-nb}.

We will perform a *customized* installation. Please read the instructions below carefully during the installation. *Do not* accept defaults all the way through, it won't work!

[arabic]
. Download the {apache-nb-cv-url}[{apache-nb-cv}] window installer
+
NOTE: Remember the folder where you store the NetBeans installer.

. *Customized* installation of NetBeans 

.. Go to the folder where you stored the downloaded NetBeans installer

.. Run the installation program as an administrator
+
TIP: Select it, right click your mouse and select "Run as administrator"

.. Answer "Yes" when prompted whether you want to run the installer
+
NOTE: NetBeans will extract and open the `Apache NetBeans IDE Installer` window.
+
TIP: If you encounter a failure due to no Java runtime or alike, please make sure you have set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable in xref:set-win-java-env-var[here].

.. In the `Apache NetBeans IDE Installer` window, do the following

... Check that the following five items are pre-selected for installation

.... `Base IDE`
.... `Java SE`
.... `Java EE`
.... `HTML5/JavaScript`
.... `PHP`

... Click the btn:[Next >] button

... Accept the license agreement after you have a good look at it :-)

... Enter `{win-nb-folder}` in the `Install the Apache NetBeans IDE to` text field
+
[WARNING]
====
If the folder name of NetBeans IDE contains space characters (for example, `{win-nb-df-folder}` - the default for MS Windows), NetBeans will not work for our {jakarta-ee} development work. It is better to change it now.
====

... Keep the pre-selected JDK in the `JDK\TM for the Apache NetBeans IDE` text field

... Click the btn:[Next >] button

... Click the btn:[Install] button

... Wait for the installation to finish

==== [[setup-nb-win]]Set up {apache-nb-cv}

. Start NetBeans (if you have not done so)

. *If you cannot see the menu option menu:Tools[Java Platform] in the pull down menu*, select menu:Tools[Plugins] in the pull down menu and do the following
+
NOTE: NetBeans will display a "Plugins" window

.. In the Plugins window, do the following

... Select the "Installed" tab
+
NOTE: There may be a number after the word "Installed" (e.g. `Installed (11)`). The number shows how many plugins have been installed.

... Check the following plugs to activate them

.... `HTML5`
.... `Java SE`
.... `Tools`
.... `Java Web and EE`
.... `Base IDE`

... Click the btn:[Activate] button
+
[NOTE]
====
NetBeans will open a "NetBeans IDE Installer" window and possibily prompt you for further required plugins to be installed.
====

... In the "NetBeans IDE Installer" window, do the following

.... Click the btn:[Activate] button
+
[NOTE]
====
. NetBeans will then install and activate all the relevant plugins.

. After all relevant plugins are installed and activated, NetBeans will prompt you to finish this activation process.
====

.... Click the btn:[Finish] button

... Click the btn:[Close] button
+
NOTE: NetBeans is now back to the original main window.

. Select menu:Tools[Java Platforms] in the pull down menu
+
NOTE: NetBeans will display a "Java Platform Manager" window.

.. In the "Java Platform Manager" window, do the following

... In the "Platforms:" text area, check whether you have either "{jdk-cv} (Default)" or "{jdk-cv}"

.... If yes, that is fine. Go to xref:setup-gf-win[here].

.... If no, do the following

..... Click the btn:[Add Platform...] button (located just below the "Platforms" text area)

..... In the "Add Java Platform" window, do the following

...... Select "Java Standard Edition"

...... Click the btn:[Next >] button
+
[NOTE]
====
. If you have only one Java version and is not "{jdk-cv} (Default)", this is a bit strange because you have already install a new `JDK {jdk-cv-full}` and this should just show "{jdk-cv} (Default)". Anyway, NetBenas display another "Add Java Platform" window and will prompt you to choose the relevant Platform Folder. In this case, you need to naviagate to your own {jdk-cv} root folder (e.g. `{win-jdk-folder}`) and select it.

. If you have multiple versions of Java installed, NetBeans will display another "Add Java Platform" window with several Java versions (JDK and JRE) for you to select. Make sure you select the appropriate `jdk-{jdk-cv-full}` that you have just installed..
====

..... Click the btn:[Next >] button

..... Click the btn:[Finish] button
+
NOTE: NetBeans now has "{jdk-cv}" in the "Java SE Platforms". Beware that, this may be different from "{jdk-cv} (Default)" which we will be using in this book.

.... Click the btn:[Close] button
